They embody the depths of the woods, and are known to kill those who walk astray in their domain. As mentioned, they are weak to fire, so carry fire-based enchantments or even a trusty flint and steel to take them out."

But this staff can also be used on animals via right-clicking to either tame or breed them, at the cost of durability."
